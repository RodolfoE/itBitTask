* This software was written using NodeJs in the backend, and vanila javascript in the frontend.
* This software uses SQL Server for data storage
* It's necessary to create a database named 'task'
* It's not necessary to create the scheme of the database. The software itself does the creation of the 3 tables used
* To run the application, install NodeJs and
  1. go to the project's root folder
  2. run 'npm install' to install project's dependencies
  3. run 'npm start' to start the application locally
  4. go to localhost:3000 on your browser
  
  It's important to notice that the software generates 20 mock users for testing purposes. It's possible to delete all, but once the last one gets deleted, it'll create 20 users again
